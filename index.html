            <h2>About Semantic Elements</h2> 
            <p>
                Semantic elements are elements with descriptive names that better communicate their meaning to the browser and developer, as opposed to non-semantic elements like divs, which are less intuitive and often overused. Semantic elements are named for their purpose and/or the content they contain. They can also benefit the overall accessibility and searchability of your site, allowing computers and assistive tools to better interpret the content of the site. Using more semantic tags is also helpful for keeping your CSS less cluttered, whereas using generic divs for everything will require you to differentiate them with more unique IDs and classes in your CSS.</p>

                <p>The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Because of its retractable claws it is adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator.

                <p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct gray wolves, and the gray wolf is the dog's closest living relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans. Hunter-gatherers did this over 15,000 years ago in Oberkassel, Bonn, which was before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.
