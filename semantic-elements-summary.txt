Semantic elements are elements with descriptive names that better communicate their meaning to the browser and developer, as opposed to non-semantic elements like divs, which are less intuitive and often overused. Semantic elements are named for their purpose and/or the content they contain. They can also benefit the overall accessibility and searchability of your site, allowing computers and assistive tools to better interpret the content of the site. Using more semantic tags is also helpful for keeping your CSS less cluttered, whereas using generic divs for everything will require you to differentiate them with more unique IDs and classes in your CSS.
